# Minecraft Custom Modpack Installer

A software that I built for my friends who want to join my minecraft modded server.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Java 1.8 or above
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

```
I used [JSON-java](https://github.com/stleary/JSON-java) (20200518) as an external library to parse json.
So don't forget to add this in your IDE.
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
## Versioning

I use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. There is also a built-in version compareer for this software.
